            <!-- he did not use div inside div method, so let's take form outside -->
            <!-- but when i look back at his code, he put the form inside the div -->
            <!-- so why did I say that? he used a form inside a div method -->
            <!-- 
                so things aren't working but it's probably bc I have the form outside the div
                let's move form inside the div
                also, formcontainer is an id selector, let's change it to class
                so, formcontainer not being style shows up
                if formcontainer is selected, then it disappears
                is this because of the image?
                yes - if background image is styled like Jon's, it works
                basically if image is defined in html vs css
                BUT WHY
                it's because styling the div is not the same as styling the image
                let's test
                still doesn't look right, but the results are interesting
                if the div background is 50% and the image is 100%, we get a small
                background image with our input box below
                however, there is still the issue that the html defined image comes on top of the input form
            -->

            <!--
                from W3C examples on position, they use
                a div container
                    inside is an img ref 
                    also inside is a div for text
                So it's a text box inside an image container
            -->

            <!-- this should be a form, oops! -->
            <!--
            <div id="userinput">
            -->
            <!--
                <form id="formcontainer">
            -->
                <form class="formcontainer">
                    <h1>Register Now To Win!</h1>
                    <!-- let's make type = email instead of text
                         and also use lable instead of floating p
                    -->
                    <label for="email">Your Email:</label>
