First we learned how to put an element on top of a background image of brocolli soup (positioning.html)

Next we did the same thing with a whole screen image which used a different implementation (vacation.html)

My implementation is messed up vs Jon's implementation.

The main goal though is to figure out the difference between the implementations and why.
