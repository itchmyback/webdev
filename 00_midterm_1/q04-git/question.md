1. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?

2. Why is the "index" or "staging area" needed in git? Put another way, why do you use the command `git add`?

### Please post your answer here. Please use your own words and do it within 50 words for each question.

1. 
git pull updates the files in your local repo
git fetch gets the updates but does not permanently change your local repo

2.
git add allows you to review your changes before committing

### Feedback:
Answer 1 - Yes! `git fetch` would not integrate the changes to your local repo.
Answer 2 - That sounds more like what `git status` would do. `git add` is more about forming your commit. Why would I want to add/stage only particular files or folders?
