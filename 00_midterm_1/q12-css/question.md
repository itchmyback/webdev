### Question:

Please use your own simple words to describe what are cascading rules in CSS. Please keep it under 150 words. Full credit given to simple explanation in own words and not a copy and paste from the documentation ;-)

### Answer:
These are the rules that determine which style command gets implemented first when there is a conflict between their precedence.


### Feedback:
Good definition so far. Just need details about the rules. You're at 20 words currently, plenty more to work with!
