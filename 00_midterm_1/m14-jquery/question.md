# I believe jquery is intended for front end, although some folks online say they use it for backend

### Feedback
Correct! jQuery is for the front end. It was useful for DOM manipulation, ajax calls for requests to apis, and animations. There has been improvements to vanilla CSS and JS to where jQuery isn't as necessary (which is why we're not really covering it). I'm wondering if the folks online are confusing using javascript as being backend. I just found an article that did exactly that.
