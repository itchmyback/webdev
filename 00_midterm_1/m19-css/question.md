### How do you add a background color to all h1 elements

1. `all.h1 {background-color: white}`
2. `h1.all {background-color: white}`
3. `h1 {background-color: #FFF}`
4. `h1 {background: #FFF}`
5. `h1 {color: #FFF}`
6. None of the above


### Please write your answer here:
3. `h1 {background-color: #FFF}`
4. `h1 {background: #FFF}`

# Both 3 and 4 work
# h1.all would also work if the all the h1's had a class="all", but that wasn't specified so not choosing it.
