### Which jQuery method is used to prevent code from running, before the HTML document is finished loading?

1. `$(window).onload()`
2. `$(document).ready()`
2. `$(body).onload()`
3. `$(document).load()`
4. `$(browser).ready()`
5. None of the above.


### Please write your answer here:
2. `$(document).ready()`

# Number 1. maybe should be load()? 
# onload() might be an old method
# 1. `$(window).onload()` doesn't seem correct
