The following questions have equal weightage. The 2nd question has a choice. Each answer MUST be completed within 150 words:

1. Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what are they used for?
# They are selector properties that allow for further refining in the selection of elements.
# As an example, an element could be selected only when highlight selected, so 'selected' pseudo-element could be used.

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between inline and inline-block?
# As both are inline elements, they default to only take up as much space as needed by their contents.
# inline cannot change height and width
# inline-block can change height and width 

3. What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?

# 
# 1. re-position the content off the screen, still technically present but not visually on the screen
# 2. CSS clip - hide anything that doesn't fit into a 1-pixel area
# 3. text-indent - indent text off of screen
