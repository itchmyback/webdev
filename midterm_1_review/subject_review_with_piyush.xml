// Piyush lecture
// What does a query selector return? a collection? an array? an element?
// It returns a DOM node object - an object
// The reason is because web development came about on an as-needed basis.
// The DOM node object was created for the browser, not for JavaScript.

// Everything is a DOM object, body down to whatever tags.

// DOM node object contains all the DOM selector methods - true or false?
// getElementsByTag('p') - not defined
// document.getElementsByTag('p') - this works, document is the higher object

// How to get/set the text of an element?
// What property do we use to get/set the HTML of an element?
// What method do we use to bind an event to an element?
// example - p.addEventListener('click','fn')
// Doesn't have to be the document, can add event listener to any element

// var mycoll = document.getElementsByTagName('p')
// missed the point here - think we were just looking at all the attributes of the DOM node object

// Going through objects, arrays
// What do you do if you don't know the keys of an object? I'm guessing you list out the keys
// What are primitives? anything that's not an object
// Is string an object? Well, it has methods.

// Operators

// Loops

// DOM Nodes - methods and lots of methods, most that we've never seen

// document ready vs window onload

// jQuery - we haven't learned - why are we reviewing?
// skipping

// git

// node.js - skipping
